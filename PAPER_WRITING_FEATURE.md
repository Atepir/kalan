# Paper Writing Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Added complete paper writing functionality to enable agents to write research papers based on their experiments and literature reviews.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Data Model (`src/activities/research.py`)
- Added `ResearchPaper` dataclass with all paper components:
  - Title, authors, abstract
  - Introduction, methodology, results, discussion, conclusion
  - References and keywords
  - Experiment IDs tracking

### 2. Core Functionality (`ResearchActivity` class)
- **`write_paper()` method**: Main entry point for paper generation
  - Takes literature review and experiments as input
  - Generates all paper sections using LLM
  - Records authorship and updates agent reputation
  - Tracks metrics

- **Section generation methods**:
  - `_generate_abstract()`: Creates 150-200 word academic abstract
  - `_generate_introduction()`: Establishes context and research gaps
  - `_generate_methodology()`: Describes experimental approaches
  - `_generate_results()`: Presents findings objectively
  - `_generate_discussion()`: Interprets results and implications
  - `_generate_conclusion()`: Summarizes contributions

### 3. Integration Points

#### Updated Files:
- `src/activities/__init__.py`: Exports `ResearchPaper` and `write_paper()`
- `src/orchestration/workflows.py`: Added TODO for workflow integration
- `scripts/run_simulation.py`: Integrated paper writing into research tasks
  - 33% chance of writing paper per research activity
  - Tracks papers_written statistics

#### Configuration:
- `.env`: Updated to use Docker Ollama on port **11435**
- `docker-compose.yml`: Maps Docker Ollama to host port **11435**

### 4. Agent Updates
When a paper is written:
- Paper ID added to `agent.papers_authored` list
- Research reputation increased via `reputation.record_publication()`
- Experience logged with paper details
- Metrics tracked

## Usage Example

```python
from src.activities.research import (
    ResearchActivity,
    LiteratureReview,
    ExperimentResult
)

# Create research activity
research = ResearchActivity(agent)

# After conducting literature review and experiments
paper = await research.write_paper(
    title="Your Paper Title",
    research_question="Your research question",
    literature_review=lit_review,
    experiments=[experiment1, experiment2],
    keywords=["ml", "ai"]
)

print(f"Paper published: {paper.paper_id}")
print(f"Abstract: {paper.abstract}")
```

## Testing

Created `test_paper_writing.py` for validation:
- ✅ Creates researcher agent
- ✅ Simulates literature review
- ✅ Simulates experiments
- ✅ Generates complete paper with all sections
- ✅ Updates agent statistics
- ✅ Tracks metrics

## Simulation Integration

Papers are now written during simulation runs:
- Researcher/Expert agents conduct research
- ~33% of research activities result in paper publication
- Statistics tracked: `papers_written` in step and total stats
- Logged with paper_id, title, and agent information

## LLM Configuration

Now using Docker Ollama:
- **Host**: `127.0.0.1`
- **Port**: `11435` (Docker) instead of 11434 (Windows)
- **Model**: `llama3.1:8b`

Each paper section is generated via separate LLM calls:
- Abstract: 300 tokens max
- Introduction: 500 tokens max
- Methodology: 600 tokens max
- Results: 600 tokens max
- Discussion: 700 tokens max
- Conclusion: 400 tokens max

## Next Steps

### Recommended Enhancements:
1. **Paper Storage**: Save papers to filesystem/database
2. **LaTeX Export**: Integration with `src/mcp_servers/writing/templates.py`
3. **Citations**: Generate proper bibliography from literature review
4. **Peer Review**: Automatically trigger review after paper writing
5. **Quality Metrics**: Assess paper quality, novelty, impact
6. **Collaboration**: Multi-author papers from collaboration workflows
7. **Revisions**: Implement revision cycles based on reviews

### Workflow Integration:
Update `CollaborationWorkflow._write_paper_node()` to:
```python
from src.activities.research import write_paper

agent = await community.get_agent(lead_agent_id)
paper = await write_paper(
    agent, 
    title, 
    research_question,
    state["literature_review"],
    state["experiments"]
)
state["paper_draft"] = paper
```

## Summary

✅ **Paper writing fully implemented and tested**
✅ **Docker Ollama configured on port 11435**
✅ **Integrated into simulation workflow**
✅ **Agents can now publish research papers!**
